We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.\n\n- Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.\n\n- This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities — online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\n- Be welcoming.\n- Be kind.\n- Look out for each other.\n\n## Unacceptable Behavior\n\n- Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.\n  - Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.\n  - Do not show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)\n- Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).\n- Disrespect towards differences of opinion.\n- Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.\n- Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.\n- Sustained disruptions.\n- Violence, threats of violence or violent language.\n\n## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Insight. This includes:\n\n- Conferences (including social events and peripheral activities)\n- Unconferences and sprints\n- Meetups, including their discussion boards\n- Workshops\n- Presentation materials used in talks or sessions\n- Slack\n- GitHub\n- Twitter hashtag and mentions\n- Any forums created by the Insight which the community uses for communication.\n\nThe Code of Conduct does not exclusively apply to slack or events on an official agenda. For example, if after a scheduled social event you go to a bar with a group of fellow participants, and someone harasses you there, we would still treat that as a CoC violation. Similarly, harassment in Twitter direct messages related to Insight can still be covered under this Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition, violations of this code outside our spaces may affect a person’s ability to participate in them.\n\n## Enforcement\n\n- Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.\n- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at hello@tooljet.com or dm @navaneeth on slack.\n- If violations occur, organizers will take any action they deem appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion.\n\n:::info\nPortions derived from the [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/), [The Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html) and [The Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/2014/02/18/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/) under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Etiquettes to follow\n\n#### 1. Be nice to everyone\n\n#### 2. Check off your resolved questions\n\nIf you have received a useful reply to your question, please drop a ✅ reaction or a reply for affirmation.\n\n#### 3. Try not to repost question\n\nIf you have asked a question and have not got a response in 24hrs, please review your question for clarity and revise it. If you still feel you haven't received adequate response, feel free to ping @navaneeth.\n\n#### 4. Post in public\n\nPlease don't direct message any individual member of Insight community without their explicit permission, independent of reason. Your question might be helpful for other community members.\n\n#### 5. Don't spam tags\n\nInsight's community of volunteer is very active and helpful, generally avoid tagging members unless it is urgent.\n\n#### 6. Use threads for discussion\n\nTo keep the main channel area clear, we request to use threads to keep an ongoing conversation organized."
