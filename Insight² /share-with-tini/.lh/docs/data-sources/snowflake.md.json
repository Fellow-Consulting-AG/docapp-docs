If you are using Insight cloud, please whitelist our IP. You can find snowflake docs on network policies **[here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies.html)**.\n\n\nTo add a new Snowflake database, click on the `+` button on data sources panel at the left-bottom corner of the app editor. Select Snowflake from the modal that pops up.\n\nInsight requires the following to connect to your Snowflake database.\n\n- **Account**\n- **Username**\n- **Password**\n\n:::info\nYou can also configure for **[additional optional parameters](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/nodejs-driver-use.html#additional-connection-options)**.\n:::\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - Snowflake connection](/img/datasource-reference/snowflake/snowflake-connect.png)\n\n</div>\n\n## Querying Snowflake\n\nClick on `+` button of the query manager at the bottom panel of the editor and select the database added in the previous step as the datasource.
