Select **AWS S3** from the modal that pops up.\n\nInsight requires the following to connect to your AWS S3:\n\n- **Region**\n- **Access key**\n- **Secret key**\n\nIt is recommended to create a new IAM user for the database so that you can control the access levels of Insight.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/aws-s3-modal.png)\n\n</div>\n\nClick on **Test connection** button to verify if the credentials are correct and that the database is accessible to Insight server. Click on **Save** button to save the data source.\n\n## Querying AWS S3\n\nClick on `+` button of the **query manager** at the bottom panel of the editor and select the data source added in the previous step as the data source. Select the operation that you want to perform and click **Save** to save the query.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/aws-s3-query.png)\n\n</div>\n\nClick on the **run** button to run the query. \n\n**NOTE**: Query should be saved before running.\n\n:::tip\nQuery results can be transformed using transformations. Read our transformations documentation to see how: **[link](/docs/tutorial/transformations)**\n:::\n\n## Query operations\n\nYou can create query for AWS S3 data source to perform several actions such as:\n  1. **[Read object](/docs/data-sources/s3#read-object)**\n  2. **[Upload object](/docs/data-sources/s3#upload-object)**\n  3. **[List buckets](/docs/data-sources/s3#list-buckets)**\n  4. **[List objects in a bucket](/docs/data-sources/s3#list-objects-in-a-bucket)**\n  5. **[Signed url for download](/docs/data-sources/s3#signed-url-for-download)**\n  6. **[Signed url for upload](/docs/data-sources/s3#signed-url-for-upload)**\n\n### Read object\n\nYou can read an object in a bucket by using this operation. It requires two parameters - **Bucket** name and **Key**.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/read-object.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### Upload object\n\nYou can use this operation to upload objects(files) to your S3 bucket. It requires four parameters:\n  1. **Bucket**: Specify the bucket name\n  2. **Key**: Key of the object/file\n  3. **Content type**: Specify file type such as text, image etc. \n  4. **Upload data**: File/object that is to be uploaded. \n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/upload-object.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### List buckets\n\nThis operation will list all the buckets in your S3. This does not require any parameter.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/list-buckets.png)\n\n</div>\n\n###  List objects in a bucket\n\nThis operation will fetch the list of all the files in your bucket. It requires two parameters:\n  1. **Bucket**: Bucket name (mandatory)\n  2. **Prefix**: To limit the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix (optional)\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/list-objects.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### Signed url for download\n\nThe object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects. For creating a presigned URL, the required parameters are:\n  1. **Bucket**: name of the bucket for uploading the file\n  2. **Key**: an object key\n  3. **Expires in**: an expiration time of URL\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/signed-download.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### Signed url for upload\n\nThe presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions. For creating a presigned URL, the required parameters are:\n  1. **Bucket**: name of the bucket for uploading the file\n  2. **Key**: an object key\n  3. **Expires in**: an expiration time of URL\n  4. **Content type**: the content type such as text, image etc.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - AWS S3 connection](/img/datasource-reference/aws-s3/signed-upload.png)\n\n</div>\n\n:::info\nWe built an app to view and upload files to AWS S3 buckets.
