It displays the version of the app that you're currently working and can be used to switch between the different version of the app. To create a new version:\n\n- Go to the **App Version Manager** and click on the dropdown. It will display all the versions of the app that have been created.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - Managing Users and Groups](/img/tutorial/versioning-and-release/appversion.png)\n\n</div>\n\n- Click on **Create Version** and a modal will pop-up. Enter a **Version Name** and click on **Create version from** dropdown that will include all the versions of the app, choose a version that you want to use for your new version and then click on `Create Version`.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - Managing Users and Groups](/img/tutorial/versioning-and-release/modal.png)\n\n</div>\n\n## Release\n\nMaking a release let's you publish the app and push the changes to production.\n\n### Releasing a version\n\nTo release a version:\n\n- Go to the **App Version Manager** and select the `version` from the dropdown that you want to release.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - Managing Users and Groups](/img/tutorial/versioning-and-release/versiondropdown.png)\n\n</div>\n\n- Click on the `Release` button on the top-right corner.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - Managing Users and Groups](/img/tutorial/versioning-and-release/release.png)\n\n</div>\n\n\n:::tip \n\nInsight will block editing of the `Released version` of an app and will display a prompt to create a new version to make the changes. This is to prevent accidentally pushing an unfinished app to the live version.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n\n![Insight - Managing Users and Groups](/img/tutorial/versioning-and-release/prompt.png)\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n"
