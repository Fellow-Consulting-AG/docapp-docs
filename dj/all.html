rounding errors. Here's an example to illustrate:</p>
<p><img alt="Example of rounding error in invoice
amount" src="/_images/docbits/Settings_Amount_2.png" title="Example of rounding error in invoice amount" /></p>
<p>To enable this feature, simply turn on the selection in the settings:</p>
<p><img alt="Enable amount settings in DocBits
(DOC²)" src="/_images/docbits/Settings_Amount_4.png" title="Enable amount settings in DocBits (DOC²)" /></p>
<p>If you don't process invoices where rounding is a matter, you can leave
this selection off.</p>
<p>Make sure your invoices are accurate and error-free with DocBits
(DOC²)'s amount settings feature. Try it out today!</p><p>With the Webhook API provided below, you can easily transfer documents
directly to DocBits (DOC²) with a simple POST request. This API is

<p>For every overpoint you can also <strong>CREATE FIELD</strong>s like freight, postage
or any field with an amount you want to extract from your invoices.</p>
<p>For each field you can check the boxes if they are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>REQUIRED: Here you can define if the field must contain a value to
    continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>READ ONLY: Here you can define if a field can only be displayed but
    not edited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIDDEN: Here you can define whether a field should be hidden or
    displayed in the extraction view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FORCE VALIDATION: Here you can define whether a field must always be
    validated manually, even if it has been read 100% by DocBits (DOC²).</p>

<p><strong>OCR:</strong></p>
<p>Here you can set the sensitivity of the OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) function for all fields at once. This value determines the
sensitivity with which a field is marked in red if it could not be
extracted with 100% certainty (OCR related!).</p>
<p><strong>MATCH SCORE:</strong></p>
<p>Here you can set the sensitivity of the MATCH SCORE function for all
fields at once. This value determines from when a field is marked in red
if DocBits (DOC²) has not extracted the field with 100% probability. In
this case the field needs to be validated manually.</p>
<p>The button <code>RESTORE DEFAULTS</code> will set back both values to "50".</p>

<p>Every business process starts, contains, or ends with a document.
Regardless of whether it's in paper form or already as a file, this is
called unstructured data. Although the information is on or in the
document, it cannot be automatically integrated into the work processes,
as it is simply not recognized by all software.</p>
<p>DocBits (DOC²) is the latest software and solution for document capture
that was developed by FellowPro AG. It is a completely cloud-based
solution that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to
precisely identify, classify, analyze, and read your documents. No
matter if paper or file. DocBits (DOC²) learns independently, the level
of experience increases with each document. DocBits (DOC²) uses swarm
intelligence for this.</p>

    information in tables reliably and is self-learning, even through
    corrections by the user</li>
<li>With swarm intelligence, you benefit continuously from the
    experiences of other customers</li>
<li>Improves the accuracy and quality of the recognized data</li>
<li>Enables an automated process without ongoing corrections and
    interventions</li>
<li>Simple intuitive interface</li>

<ol>
<li>Scanning and Recognition of all types of documents (Invoices,
    Contracts, Forms, Medical Prescriptions, etc.)</li>
<li>Reliable extraction of the data in the document and integration and
    further processing in the ERP, RPA, or CRM system)</li>

    Management, Workflow System, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why DocBits (DOC²) is Just Right for You:</h2>
<p>Many companies have recognized that processing incoming invoices, for
example, can be very time-consuming. They are trying to increase
productivity and optimize the purchase-to-pay process by introducing
products for the "digitization" of invoices.</p>
<p>In addition, DocBits (DOC²) uses swarm intelligence. What does that
mean? You benefit from the experiences of other customers and their
"learning curve" without sharing sensitive data. With the cloud-based
rule engine, we ensure continuous improvement of the application. You
don't need any developers or data scientists, because the system learns
from the input of the user and the process runs without interruptions.</p>
<p>With the help of deep learning algorithms, not only simple header data
of a document can be recorded, but also complicated structures such as
tables. Of course, not only invoices are processed, but all types of
documents. Regardless of whether it is waybills, membership
applications, medical prescriptions, and many more.</p>

<p>Infor Document Management (IDM) is an enterprise document management
application deployed and integrated within the Infor Operating Service
portal.</p>
<p>IDM is one of several Infor applications that uses the user interface of
Infor Ming.leTM.</p>
<p>IDM is a central repository where you can manage your common business
rules for creating, storing, and managing documents -- such as invoices,
vendor document, and employee records. You can view, edit, create, and
store the physical files.</p>
<p>You can extend IDM with DocBits (DOC²). It provides optical character
recognition (OCR) and intelligent character recognition (ICR)
capabilities. These tools enable more complete and improved document
capture processes. You can scan and connect your documents through a
standard web browser and connect the documents to your business process.
With IDM you can find the documents you require and you are always
working with the latest, most complete version of a document. With
access to all your critical business information in-context, DocBits
(DOC²) further automates your document workflows through automatic
categorization and retrieval of key document metadata.</p>
<h2>Accessing IDM</h2>
<p>Access the application with the IDM URL.</p>
<p>By accessing the system through this URL, you are ensured that the
required libraries are loaded during the page load. Otherwise, several
features such as Shortcuts and Context Sharing, do not work properly.
The IDM URL is provided to your IDM administrator.</p>
<p>After logging in you can access the client application through the app
switcher in the Infor Ming.le portal.</p>

<li>:fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:{ style="color: #EE0F0F"
    } Warning - yellow sign: The warning sign does not disable
    <strong>Import XML file</strong>. We recommend that you go through all
    warning messages before starting the importer. This could be due
    to these situations:</li>
<li>Some configuration parts already exist in the repository that
    might be overwritten, for example, Result List.</li>
<li>Some configuration parts already exist in the repository that
    might be lost, for example, Document Type Filter.</li>
<li>:fontawesome-solid-info:{ style="color: #eee20e" } Information -
    blue sign: The information sign does not disable Import XML

<li>If some parts cannot be imported, for example, Items.</li>
<li>If some existing parts are merged with new ones from the XML
    file, for example, Result List.</li>
<li>A green OK sign with no message required.</li>

<li>Click <strong>Import XML file</strong> to run the importer. When the import is

<p>This is how the general Information and attributes look like in IDM
under the corresponding document type:</p>

<p>DocBits (DOC²) seamlessly integrates with Infor LN/M3 through ION API,
ION Desk, and Infor Standard BODs. Our API integration allows us to
export data to Infor and perform master data validation in DocBits
(DOC²).</p>
<h3>Exporting Data to Infor</h3>
<p>We use the ION API to send the PDF with attributes to IDM and the BOD
Sync.CaptureDocument to ION Desk. In ION Desk, we transform the
Sync.CaptureDocument to the desired target BODs based on the document
type being processed. These transformed Infor BODs are then
automatically imported to LN or M3.</p>
<h3>Master Data Validation in DocBits (DOC²)</h3>
<p>To identify the supplier or compare/match purchase order lines, we
activate a trigger in LN/M3 that sends the Sync.RemitToPartyMaster,
Sync.SupplierPartyMaster, and Sync.PurchaseOrder BODs to DocBits (DOC²).
We configure this process in ION Desk by defining the dataflow to a
specific connection point to DocBits (DOC²).</p>

<h3>Open port</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Communication with the Database</h3>
<p>Kubernetes and our Databases are inside the same VPC. We only access the
database via the local IP, this way the transferred data never leaves
the local network. Additionally, we only use SSL secured connections to
communicate with the database.</p>
<h3>Spaces</h3>
<p>The uploaded documents are stored in a Space. The traffic is secured via
SSL and multiple keys are required to access the stored files.</p>
<h3>Traffic Security</h3>
<p>We only allow https secured connections to communicate with our servers.
This ensures that the transferred data is encrypted and secure.</p>
<h2>Infor Cloud</h2>

<p>API integration provides functions and services that connect
applications and processes. In this guide, we will show you how to make
API calls through api.polydocs.io for document upload and status check.</p>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>To make API calls, authentication is the first step. Follow the steps
below to authenticate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <a href="https://api.polydocs.io/docs">api.polydocs.io</a>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Authorize</strong> in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>Enter your <a href="/docbits/settings/integration/api-integration/">API Key</a>
    and confirm by clicking <code>Authorize</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Authorize API
Key" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Integration/API%20calls%20examples/1-admin_guides_doc2-api-authorize.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<h2>Upload Document</h2>
<p>To upload a document, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>After authentication, scroll down to the <strong>POST /document/process</strong>
    endpoint.</li>
<li>Open the tab and click on <code>Try it out</code> in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>Enter the following value in the <code>source</code> field:
    <code>email:{Pattern name}</code>.</li>
<li>Select the file you want to upload and click <code>Execute</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your document will be uploaded to your dashboard with the rules you set
in <a href="https://app.polydocs.io/settings/classify-extract">DocBits (DOC²)</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Classification
Rules" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Integration/API%20calls%20examples/5-classification_rules.png" />{loading="lazy"}
<img alt="Uploaded Document on
Dashboard" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Integration/API%20calls%20examples/6-dashboard_mango.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<h2>Document Status Check</h2>
<p>To check the status of a document, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>After authentication, scroll down to the <strong>GET /document/status</strong>
    endpoint.</li>
<li>Open the tab and click on <code>Try it out</code> in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>Enter the document ID in the <code>doc-id</code> field. You can find the
    document ID when you open the document on the dashboard. This is the
    last part of the URL when the document is open.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Document
ID" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Integration/API%20calls%20examples/8-DOC2_API_GET_Document-Status_doc_id.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<p>You will receive the following response:</p>
<p><img alt="Document Status
Response" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Integration/API%20calls%20examples/9-DOC2_API_GET_Document-Status_Response.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<p>If the status is "Ready For Validation," it means that the user can
check the document.</p>
<h2>Upload Document with Metadata</h2>
<p>To upload a document with metadata, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>After authentication, scroll down to one of these endpoints:
    <code>/document/process_documents</code>, <code>/document/process</code>, or
    <code>/document/process_base64</code>.</li>
<li>Open the tab and click on <code>Try it out</code> in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>Enter the metadata in the <code>metadata</code> field. The metadata needs to be
    in a valid JSON format. An example of a metadata entry would be:
    <code>{"custom-key": "the custom value", "custom_doc_id": "8a5cf33b-c923-4879-96ca-94d69965d508"}</code>.</li>
<li>Select a file to upload.</li>
<li>Click <code>Execute</code>.</li>
<li>Wait for the response. If the metadata field is not a valid JSON, an
    error message will appear. If "success": true, then your document
    will be uploaded to your dashboard with the rules you set in
    <a href="https://app.polydocs.io/settings/classify-extract">DocBits (DOC²)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these simple steps, you can easily make API calls for
document upload and status check using api.polydocs.io. For more

<p>Now you can customize the Approval features according to your
requirements.</p>
<h1>Understanding the Document Exporting Process in Docbits</h1>
<p>When you are ready to export a document, select an export option from
the dropdown at the document's bottom.</p>
<p><img alt="Confirm and Export
Option" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Approval/Image_5.png" /></p>
<p>If the feature is enabled, the document's status will change to "Pending
Approval".</p>
<p><img alt="Pending
Approval" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Approval/Image_6.png" /></p>
<p>The document is now in queue for approval.</p>
<p>Assign the approver using the "assign" button on the Dashboard. You can
also manage e-mail notifications for the approver(s) through Settings >
Email Notification.</p>
<p><img alt="Email Notification
1" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Approval/Image_7.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Email Notification
2" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Approval/Image_8.png" /></p>
<p>Use the Approval Before Export feature to streamline your document
management process in Docbits, making your workflows more efficient.</p><p>If you want to use scripts that, for example, convert currency
characters or written-out currency names into ISO codes, please activate
this first in the settings under Module > Document Type > Doc Script.</p>
<p>\&lt;Script_Settings_Module_Doc Script.png></p>
<p>After that, go to the desired document type - in our example Invoice,
open Scripts , copy the script below and overwrite the example with this
one. Then click on SAVE.</p>
<p>\&lt;Script_Invoice_Scripts.png></p>
<p>The result should look like this:</p>
<p>\&lt;Script_added.png></p>
<pre><code> currency_map = {
 "€": "EUR",
 "EURO": "EUR",
 "$": "USD",
 "£": "GBP"
 }

 currency_value = get_field_value(fields_dict, "currency", None)

 if currency_value:
     currency_value = currency_value.upper()
     currency_value = currency_map.get(currency_value, currency_value)
     set_field_value(fields_dict, "currency", currency_value)
</code></pre>
<p>In the next step, upload a document with one of the following criteria:
"€", "EURO", "\$" or "£".</p>
<p>When the document is ready for validation, open this and click in the
Currency validation field. You will be prompted to select the
appropriate area on the image. Now do this with the € sign.</p>
<p>\&lt;Script_Currency_select area on image€.png></p>
<p>You will then immediately see that € is converted to EUR by the script.</p>
<p>\&lt;Script_conversion_currency_1.png></p>
<p>The same is done by the script when you mark EURO on the invoice.</p>
<p>\&lt;Script_Currency_select area on imageEURO.png></p>

<h2>FritzBox network settings</h2>
<p>If you get the following error after installing and calling up the url
https://local.polydocs.io:12500/ , here are the reasons: - DNS
resolution of private IP addresses not possible. - DNS resolution for
domain names that refer to private IP addresses in the FRITZ!Box home
network is not possible via the FRITZ!Box. This means that server
services in the FRITZ!Box home network cannot be accessed via the domain
name.</p>
<p>You may see one of the following error messages: "DNS timed out" "DNS
request timed out"</p>
<p><em>Caused</em></p>
<p>For security reasons, the FRITZ!Box suppresses DNS responses that refer
to IP addresses in your own home network. This is a security feature of
the FRITZ!Box to protect against so-called DNS rebinding attacks.</p>
<p>If you use a FritzBox, you must first make the following settings in the
FritzBox menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the FRITZ!Box user interface, click on <code>Heimnetz</code>.</li>
<li><code>Heimnetz</code> Click in the menu <code>Netzwerk</code>.</li>
<li>Click on the tab <code>Netzwerkeinstellungen</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Hostname exceptions <code>DNS-Rebind-Schutz section</code>, enter
local.polydocs.io for which DNS rebind protection should not apply.
Confirm with . <code>Übernehmen</code></p>

<p>WSD stands for "Web Services on Devices" and is a network
    communication protocol used for printer discovery and management
    over a local area network. In WSD mode, printers can be
    automatically discovered and added to a computer system without
    requiring manual configuration or installing additional printer
    drivers. It enables easy setup and printing to compatible printers
    over a network. WSD mode is commonly used in Windows operating
    systems to discover and connect printers on the network.</p>

</ul><h2>Accessing the Layout Builder</h2>
<p>First of all, ensure that the Layout Manager feature is activated. This
can be done by navigating to Settings > Document Processing > Module
> Document Type and ensure that the Layout Builder slider is set too
active as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="Access Layout
Builder" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%201%20-%20Accessing%20Layout%20Manager.png" /></p>
<p>After this is done you can access the Layout Manager via Settings >
Document Types, once on this page you can select from the various
document types you have created and either select "Edit Layout" as shown
below</p>
<p><img alt="Edit
Layout" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%202%20-%20Edit%20Layout.png" /></p>
<p>or if you have sub-document types within a created document type you can
select "Document Sub Types" and select "Edit Layout" for the sub
document type layout you wish to edit as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="Edit Sub Document
Types" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%203%20-%20Doc%20Sub%20Types.png" /></p>
<h2>Basics of the Layout Manager</h2>
<p>After following the previous steps you will reach a page like the one
shown below.</p>
<h3>Uploading a document</h3>
<p>In order to upload a document to the layout builder, simply navigate to
the right on the screen</p>
<p><img alt="Upload
Document" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%204%20-%20Uploading%20a%20Doc%201.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the "Upload Documents" button or drag and drop your desired
document into the provided area</p>
<p><img alt="Upload
Document" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%205%20-%20Uploading%20a%20Doc%202.png" /></p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>Groups can be created by selecting the following icon.</p>
<p><img alt="Create
Group" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%206%20-%20Groups%201.png" /></p>
<p>Groups allow you to create different sections on a layout, this makes it
easier to separate different groups of data or information to make a
layout easier to follow. You can create a title for each group so that a
user can know what information they will find in that group.</p>
<p><img alt="Groups" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%207%20-%20Groups%202.png" /></p>
<h3>Form Elements</h3>
<p><img alt="Form
Elements" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%208%20-%20Form%20Elements.png" /></p>
<p>These are a set of default fields that can be dragged and dropped into
the layout builder and are available to you to create your desired
layout. These include:</p>
<p>Text - This is a text box which creates a field in the layout that can
have text entered into it once on the validation screen.</p>
<p>Label - This is a field that can be used to create uneditable text, this
could be used to create sub-headings or any other desired uneditable
text when on the validation screen.</p>
<p>Checkbox - This creates a boolean type field which can be checked or
unchecked.</p>
<p>Multi Checkbox - This functions the same way as the "Checkbox" but can
be used when the user knows they will be adding multiple checkboxes in
one section.</p>
<p>Horizontal Separator - This creates a horizontal line on the layout that
can be used to split up sections within a group on the layout.</p>
<p>Table of Checkboxes - This lets the user create a table of checkboxes
consisting of custom x- and y-axis values, eg.</p>
<p><img alt="Table of
Checkboxes" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%209%20-%20Table%20of%20Checkboxes.png" /></p>
<p>Button - This creates a clickable button on the validation screen within
the layout that can be set to one of three functions, including: Export,
Export mit Sonderwunsch or Reject.</p>
<h3>Creating document specific fields</h3>
<p>The user is able to create their own custom groups and fields for a
document type, this can be done when originally creating a document type
but also by selecting "Fields" when on the Document Types page in
Settings.</p>
<p><img alt="Fields" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2010%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%201.png" /></p>
<h3>Creating blank spaces</h3>
<h4>The 100 percent rule</h4>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2011%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%202.png" /></p>
<p>In order to create the above space on the layout, a "Label" from the
Form Elements must be used in a special way. The reason for this is that
the Layout Manager operates according to a 100 space per line system in
that 1 space represents 1 percent of a line, this means that fields can
only take up 100 spaces per line as show below.</p>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2012%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%203png.png" /></p>
<p>This means that the user must build the layout line by line according to
this rule. For example lets say you would like to add the fields "Name"
and "Date" in the same line but would like the "Name" field to be
larger. This can be done by dragging and dropping the "Text" field from
the Field Elements drop down and naming each field "Name" and "Date" as
shown.</p>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2013%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%204.png" /></p>
<p>The problem now exists that they are both the same size of 33 (this is
the default size of all dragged and dropped fields) but you would like
the "Name" field to be larger than the "Date" field and both fields
should take up the entire line on the layout. Therefore, by following
the 100 percent rule, you can set the "Name" and "Date" fields to any
combination of 100 that you would desire. This of course depends on how
large you would like each individual field but for the purpose of this
example we will set the "Name" field to 70 and the "Date" field to 30,
the results are:</p>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2014%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%205.png" /></p>
<p>This same rule applies to all fields in the Layout Manager.</p>
<h4>Creating Blank Spaces</h4>
<p>Now that this rule has been explained, creating blank spaces will make
more sense. As previously mentioned, in order to create a blank space
you have to use a "Label" from the Form Elements.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you would like to create a blank space
between these two fields.</p>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2015%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%206.png" /></p>
<p>Step one is to drag and drop a "Label" between these two fields, once
added you can click on the "Label" field you just added and on the left
you will be presented with the properties of the field. Now, in the same
way you would create or change the name of a field as shown previously,
you will remove any name from the "Label" property like so</p>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2016%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%207.png" /></p>
<p>The result from doing this will then be</p>
<p><img alt="Blank
Spaces" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2017%20-%20Blank%20Spaces%208.png" /></p>
<p>There is now a gap between the two fields. This gap can be extended or
shortened according to the 100 percent rule discussed earlier, and with
these functions you can create any desired layout.</p>
<h3>Field Grouping</h3>
<p>This feature allows you to group multiple fields together so that only
one field from each group can be selected at a time on the validation
screen.</p>
<p><img alt="Field
Grouping" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2018%20-%20Field%20Grouping.png" /></p>
<p>For example, if you had multiple checkboxes all belonging to a group
name "1" then only one checkbox from group "1" can be ticked on the
validation screen.</p>
<h3>KI Model Types</h3>
<p><img alt="KI
Models" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2019%20-%20KI%20Models%201.png" /></p>
<p>This dropdown gives you the choice of training a specific field
according to a KI model. Possible options can be seen below.</p>
<p><img alt="KI
Models" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/Layout%20Builder/Image%2020%20-%20KI%20Models%202.png" /></p>
<p>KI model training can lead to more accurate extraction results on the
validation screen.</p><h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>This is a feature which, every 6 hours, uses the ION-API file to connect
to your Infor-IDM and check through the newest/latest documents of the
IDM-document-type(s) the DocBits (DOC²) team has configured at your
request, and if the document type has an incorrect ACL-Setting (for
example public), it will then be changed to the ACL-Setting you want
(for example private). The image below illustrates the configuration of
the API performing this feature:</p>
<p><img alt="Dataflow" src="/_images/docbits/Settings/Module/IDM:ACL%20Updater/image_1_data_flow.png" /></p>
<p>The API is called "DOC2-Error" and is situated at the end in the above
dataflow. The endpoint mapped to the API (DOC2_Import) is the endpoint
which carries out the functions discussed earlier.</p>
<p>```{=html}</p>

<p>If you're looking to streamline your invoice processing, PO matching is
a crucial step. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of PO
matching for invoices, from creating a purchase order in LN to checking
the receipt of the invoice in LN.</p>
<h2>Create a Purchase Order in LN</h2>
<p>To get started, open LN and go to the Purchase Order Intake Workbench.
From there, select Purchase Orders and add a new one by choosing the +
symbol. You can then create the document and the corresponding table and
its values. First, add the Business Partner via the search function, and
then add the order lines. After that, save the purchase order and
approve it so that the settings are relayed to the system.</p>
<h2>Upload the Invoice in DocBits (DOC²)</h2>
<p>Once you've created the purchase order in LN, it's time to upload the
invoice in DocBits (DOC²). The symbol under MATCHED indicates the
current matching status -- green for matched and red for not matched.
Ideally, it is already green. Open the document and validate the
extracted fields. After validating all extracted fields, open the
matching overview by clicking on PO MATCHING. Here, you can see the
current matching status and make any necessary corrections.</p>
<h3>Case 1: Matched</h3>
<p>If the quantity of items ordered matches the quantity on the invoice,
the match and thus the document can be validated and exported.</p>
<h3>Case 2: Not Matched</h3>
<p>If the quantity of the ordered item does not match the quantity on the
invoice, you can correct the matches by deleting the match on the
invoice or adding a new match from the purchase order. Once everything
is correct, the document can be validated and exported.</p>
<h2>Check the Receipt of the Invoice in LN</h2>
<p>To see if the process was successful, you can check this in LN by
choosing "Process Payables Workbench" and searching by invoice number in
the corresponding field. If you click on the icon to open the overview,
you will see the order and the assigned invoice.</p>

<ol>
<li>with the corresponding
    <a href="/docbits/pomatching/po-matching-invoices/">invoice</a></li>
<li>with the corresponding <a href="/docbits/pomatching/po-matching-delivery-notes/">delivery
    note</a> and <a href="/docbits/pomatching/po-matching-order-confirmation/">order
    confirmation</a><code>&lt;br&gt;</code>{=html}
    All three components must match within agreed-upon tolerance levels.
    It is then entered into the AP system.</li>
<li>with all the above documents, but also requires control information
    such as actual number of items delivered and their quality control.
    Once all 4 components match, the invoice is entered into the AP
    database.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Corresponding settings must be made in DocBits (DOC²) under Settings - Modules - Purchase Order</h4>

<p>If you're using DocBits (DOC²) for document/table extraction, it's
important to save and delete rules properly to ensure your data is
extracted accurately. This guide will walk you through the process.</p>
<h2>Save Rules</h2>
<p>Once you've trained a document in DocBits (DOC²) and defined all the
rules for table extraction, you can save those rules for future imports.
This means that the tables in your documents will be extracted
automatically, without any manual training required.</p>
<p>To save your rules, simply click the "SAVE RULES" button. You'll see a
rule indicator that shows how many rules have been defined and saved for
that document.</p>
<p><img alt="Save Rules
Button" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/9-Save%20and%20delete%20rules/Image_47_save_rules.png" title="Save Rules Button" /></p>
<h2>Delete Rules</h2>
<p>If you need to delete rules for a document, you can do so using the
"DELETE RULES" button. This may be necessary if rules have been saved
incorrectly or if you need to retrain a document.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that deleting rules will affect all
documents with the same or similar format. This means that you'll need
to retrain those documents from scratch. So, be sure to use this feature
with caution.</p>

:::</p><h1>Manual row selection</h1>
<p>It is possible that on some documents text in rows is not only written
under one column. It might happen that it is written through different
columns like in the example below:</p>
<p><img alt="Document
Example" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/7-Manual%20row%20selection/Image_23_doc_example.png" /></p>
<p>On the screenshot you can see that the table and columns have already
been defined. Having a detailed look on the highlighted information
(PRAEF) you will recognize that the text is written through columns
"Bezeichnung", "Menge", "ME" and "Preis in EUR".</p>
<p><a href="https://app.polydocs.io">Sign up for a 30 days free trail</a>{.md-button
.md-button--primary}</p>
<p>In that case it is not possible for the system to automatically define
to which column the information belongs.</p>
<p>To solve this issue DocBits (DOC²) offers a possibility to manually
select and map information on a document to any column.</p>
<p>First of all make sure training mode is activated:</p>
<p><img alt="Training
Mode" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/7-Manual%20row%20selection/Image_24_training_mode_on.png" /></p>
<p>In addition you need to activate the row edit mode:</p>
<p><img alt="Edit Row
Data" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/7-Manual%20row%20selection/Image_25_Row_data_edit_on.png" /></p>
<p>Please note that the manual mapping of text to a column is only possible
for extractable columns (blue colour):</p>
<p><img alt="Result" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/7-Manual%20row%20selection/Image_25(1)_result.png" /></p>
<p>The violet ones can not be mapped manually as the mapping has already
been done via the columns defined on the document.</p>
<p>Extractable columns need to be created first. You will learn here how
that works: <a href="/docbits/table/add-new-table-column/">Add new table column</a></p>
<p>Once the column has been created, training mode and row edit mode are
activated you can map text on the document to the column as shown in the
video below:</p>
<p>In the video you can see how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>select an area with your mouse</li>
<li>double click a value to select the area (only possible for values
    without spaces)</li>
<li>delete mapping and re-map the area</li>
</ul><h1>Group function to extract data from tables</h1>
<p>Once a table has been extracted via DocBits (DOC²) and the columns have
been mapped (<a href="/docbits/table-extraction/mapping-of-columns/">Mapping of
columns</a>) the obtained
data can be grouped to get a structured result set of all extracted
data.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.polydocs.io">Sign up for a 30 days free trail</a>{.md-button
.md-button--primary}</p>
<h2>What does this mean in detail?</h2>
<p>All documents from order confirmations to invoices can vary enormously
in complexity from company to company. For example, in documents,
information may be presented in tables in some columns across multiple
rows and in other columns across only one row.</p>
<p>As an example, you can see the German invoice below, where the
information in column "Bezeichnung" extends over several lines
(positions).</p>
<p><img alt="Grouping
Example" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/6-Group%20Function/Image_20_grouping_example.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<p>At this point, another advantage of DocBits (DOC²) comes into play. It
extracts the data in the first step 1 to 1. The result looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="DocBits (DOC²) Grouping
Example" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/6-Group%20Function/Image_21_grouping_example_doc2.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<p>BUT: Now there is the possibility to group data based on a specific
column. That means in this case it can be grouped by the column
"Position" as shown in the following video. This in turn groups the rows
of the "Description" column into one row. So that at the end you get a
structured overall picture of the export and the data can now be
processed further.</p>
<p>If the grouping was created by mistake, it can be removed at any time,
as also shown in the video.</p>
<p>The result of grouping looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Grouping
Result" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/6-Group%20Function/Image_22_grouping_result.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p><p>Mapping columns is a crucial step in accurate table extraction using
DocBits (DOC²). Once you've extracted data from a document, you can map
the extracted columns with the columns given by DocBits (DOC²). This
ensures that the extracted data is correctly placed in the corresponding
columns.</p>
<p>To map columns, simply select the header of a column in the extraction
view. A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select the column you
want to map. If you've mapped a column incorrectly, you can easily
re-map it by clicking the dropdown menu again.</p>
<p>Check out our tutorial video below for a detailed guide on how to map
and re-map columns in DocBits (DOC²):</p>

<h2>Training Mode vs Correction Mode</h2>
<p>When using our table extraction tool, you can choose between training
mode and correction mode. Here's what you need to know about each mode:</p>
<h3>Training Mode</h3>
<p>In training mode, mapped columns are read-only, and you cannot manually
change the text. Additionally, the delete row button is not visible.</p>
<p><img alt="Table Extraction Training
Mode" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/2-Training%20table%20extraction/Image_3_training_mode.png" />{
loading=lazy, alt: "Table Extraction Training Mode" }</p>
<h3>Correction Mode</h3>
<p>In correction mode, you can delete and add rows, and you can manually
change the text of mapped columns.</p>
<p><img alt="Table Extraction Correction
Mode" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/2-Training%20table%20extraction/Image_4_correction_mode.png" />{
loading=lazy, alt: "Table Extraction Correction Mode" }</p>
<p>Here's an example of a table in correction mode, with the first row
deleted and a new row added:</p>

<h2>Start Your Table Extraction Training Today</h2>
<p>Ready to learn how to extract tables from your documents like a pro?
Sign up for our table extraction training today and get started!</p><p><strong>Define tables</strong></p>
<p>To define tables and columns on a document please import a document,
open it and go to the table extraction view like already known (via
"Line Items").</p>
<p>You will end up in following screen where you can activate the Training
Mode:</p>
<p><img alt="Activate Training
Mode" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_6_activate_training_mode.png" /></p>
<p>Via the "Edit" button table selection mode will be activated and you
will be able to edit the document shown on the left side:</p>
<p><img alt="Edit
Button" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_7_edit_button.png" /></p>
<p>In general your are now able to use the autodetect tables functionality
and the system will automatically define the tables on the document:</p>
<p><img alt="Auto
Detect" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_8_auto_detect_button.png" /></p>
<p>If the system is not able to find the tables automatically you can
manually define the tables on the document like shown in the video
below:</p>
<p><strong>Define columns</strong></p>
<p>Once the tables are defined you can manually define the columns via the
following button:</p>
<p><img alt="Add
Column" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_9_add_column_button.png" /></p>
<p>Define and sort the columns via drag and drop on the document like shown
in the video below:</p>
<p>Repeat this for the tables on the other pages as well. As an alternative
if the tables are equal on each page you can use the following button to
use the same column for all tables defined in the document. This
functionality copies the columns that you have defined to all other
pages as well:</p>
<p><img alt="Repeat
Columns" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_10_repeat_columns_button.png" /></p>
<p>If the document is very confusing, it can be zoomed in and out using the
"Zoom in" and "Zoom out" functionality. This is helpful, for example,
when a lot of information is close together and this makes it difficult
to define the columns:</p>
<p><img alt="Zoom
Button" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_11_zoom.png" /></p>
<p>If you defined a column by mistake it can be selected by clicking it and
deleted again via the following button:</p>
<p><img alt="Delete
Column" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/3-Define%20tables%20and%20columns/Image_12_delete_column.png" /></p>
<p>Note: The button is only visible if the column is selected.</p>
<p>If you are done defining all tables and all columns on your document use
the "Save" button to activate your changes and to extract the data from
the document:</p>
<p><img alt="Save

difference for yourself!</p><p>In the table extraction view, you will find the menu item <code>Settings</code> in
the upper action bar (make sure that the training mode is activated). If
you click on the gear icon, a window will open in which you will find
the <code>Advanced Settings</code>.</p>

<h2>Below functionalities are available in general settings:</h2>
<h4>Header row count</h4>
<p>Here you can define the number of lines of a table header. For example,
the table header line can be two lines:</p>
<p><img alt="Advanced
Settings" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/8-Advanced%20settings/Image_29_header_row_example.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<p>Accordingly, the value in "Header row count" is set to two:</p>
<p><img alt="Advanced
Settings" src="/_images/docbits/Table-Extraction/8-Advanced%20settings/Image_30_header_row_settings.png" />{loading="lazy"}</p>
<p>Why is this needed? It might be that DocBits (DOC²) does not recognize
the second line in the table header as header line. In this case, it
incorrectly inserts it into the table as extracted value. This can be
easily prevented with this function.</p>

<h4>Move Extra Rows to</h4>
<p>In this example, the item description in the table spans several rows,
but you only need the first one. To extract only this and include it in
the Description column, select <code>Move Extra Rows to</code> <code>Trash</code>.</p>

<h2>How to Use the AI Indicators in DocBits (DOC²)</h2>
<p>DocBits (DOC²) offers powerful AI indicators that allow you to measure
the quality of extraction for your documents. Here's how to use them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a document from the dashboard.</li>
<li>
<p>In document view, you'll see two indicators for the quality of
    extraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extraction quality in percent per field and current document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall extraction quality including previous extractions of
    documents of the same type.</p>
<p><img alt="Extraction quality in percent per field and current
document" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/4-AI%20Indicator/Image_3_Field_Accuracy.png" />
3.  For each field, there is a value available on the right side that
    indicates the quality of extraction for the current document. A
    percentage value will be displayed.
4.  Furthermore, there is a graph that shows the quality of all previous
    extractions for a document type. This refers in each case to the
    extraction value with the lowest quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<h2>Explanation of the AI Indicator</h2>
<p>The AI indicator shows how well a document is trained. This is done via
an internal score. As soon as a document is read in and the fields
extracted by DocBits (DOC²) are confirmed by the user, this score is
increased. The higher the score, the further the display of the AI
indicator will be in the green area. If fields are changed manually by
the user after the export, this score will decrease again, and the
display of the AI indicator will fall back into the red area. Only when
the document has been taught and the extraction has determined the
correct value for some imports without manual intervention will the
score reach 100%.</p>
<h2>Improve Your Document Processing with DocBits (DOC²)</h2>
<p>DocBits (DOC²) is a powerful tool that can help you streamline your
document processing and improve your workflow. With its advanced AI
indicators, you can measure the quality of extraction for your documents
and make adjustments as needed. Try DocBits (DOC²) today and see how it
can help you work smarter, not harder.</p><h3>How to Validate a document</h3>
<p>After you have uploaded a document as described
<a href="/docbits/dashboard/">here</a> and perform the following steps to validate
it:</p>
<p>1. Go to <code>HOME</code> where you will find the DASHBOARD with uploaded
documents</p>
<p><img alt="Dashboard" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_dashboard_1.png" /></p>
<p>2. Click on the bar to open the document. In this case it doesn't
matter if you click on the document name or the status.</p>
<p><img alt="Document" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_invoice-details_2.png" /></p>
<p>On the left-hand side, you can see the documents preview, where you can
also jump from one to the other page when you document has more than
just one page. In the middle part of the screen, you have the big
overview of the document where you can also see the extracted values
marked in purple. And, finally, on the right-hand side you have all the
segments of the extracted values.</p>
<p>Let's focus on this last part.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the top right side you can define the document origin if
needed:</p>
<p><img alt="Amount/Date" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_amount-and-date-format_3.png" /></p>
<p>For different origins the document can have different amount and date
formats. To be sure dates and figures/amounts will be extracted
correctly make sure the document origin is set properly.</p>
<p>Now, we get the basic information like invoice number, date etc. If you
click on the field of invoice number for example, you get directly
marked where on the invoice it was extracted.</p>
<p><img alt="Invoice
Number" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_invoice-number_4.png" /></p>
<p>You can now check if the number was extracted correctly. All values that
were correctly extracted you confirm with the checkmark. You can do this
with every single field. Another important point is that on the right
side of each field you get a percentage of the confidence level of the
DocBits (DOC²).</p>
<p>All values that have been correctly extracted and confirmed with the
check mark will have a green bar at the beginning of the field.</p>
<p><img alt="Fields" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_correct-fields_5.png" /></p>
<p>A great example is on the next segment of field IBAN, where the IBAN is
not even extracted, as confidence level is equal to 0. To train and
extract the value, just enter the field and mark the IBAN on the
invoice. You get this message if you are sure of your selection, so
click yes.</p>
<p><img alt="Field Training
Confirmation" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_confirm_field_6.png" /></p>
<p>The selected value will be extracted to the IBAN field and displayed on
the invoice. Please confirm the value with the checkmark to finalize it.</p>
<p><img alt="Confirmation" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_click-check_7.png" /></p>
<p>The procedure for each extracted or non-extracted value is always the
same. Here are some examples of the values extracted from an invoice:</p>
<p><img alt="VAT
Rate" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_vat-rate_8.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Supplier" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_supplier-name_9.png" /></p>
<p>For the vendor details we have configured the Fuzzy search, where the
supplier identification is matched by the master data imported from your
ERP system. If for example the supplier's name was missing you could
also look it up in this table. Everything is set up very easily and
user-friendly so this job of making the validation is faster.</p>
<p>After checking all the fields available for extraction, you can confirm
the changes and export directly. If you have to interrupt editing,
e.g. because of a last-minute appointment or a phone call, you can also
save the changes you have confirmed up to that point and continue later.</p>
<p><img alt="Save" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_save_10.png" /></p>
<p>When you have saved the changes, the document remains in the Ready for
Validation status.</p>
<p><img alt="Ready for Validation
Status" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/1-Index/DOC2_dashboard_11.png" /></p>

<h2>Master Data Validation for Streamlined Document Processing</h2>
<p>DocBits (DOC²) offers a powerful solution for efficient document
processing: master data validation. With this feature, supplier data
extracted from documents can be matched with your ERP system's master
data, automatically assigning the document to the correct supplier
without any manual work.</p>
<h3>Matching by VAT Number</h3>
<p>One way to match supplier data is by using the VAT number extracted from
the document. DocBits (DOC²) automatically matches the VAT number with
the supplier master data you've uploaded to the system. The supplier ID
and corresponding data, such as name and address, are then determined
automatically.</p>
<p>If needed, you can manually intervene at any time and call up the
supplier provided. This is done via the following button:</p>
<p><img alt="Call up supplier
data" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/2%20-%20Master%20Data%20Validation/image_1_fuzzy_search.png" /></p>
<h3>Finding by Supplier Name</h3>
<p>Another way to find the correct supplier is by searching for their name
in the supplier master data. Simply click the button in the supplier
name field and search for the supplier in the master data.</p>
<p><img alt="Search for supplier in master
data" src="/_images/docbits/Document%20Validation/2%20-%20Master%20Data%20Validation/image_2_search_supplier_name.png" /></p>
<h3>Tax Country</h3>
<p>Based on the ISO Code alpha-2 field, the Tax Country field gets filled
with the first section of this element, for example DE for Germany. The
Tax Code field is filled with the second section of this element.</p>

<p>You can download a example mapping file here:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.cloudintegration.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BOD_Mappings.txt">BOD mapping
example</a><a href="https://docs.cloudintegration.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BOD_Mappings.txt">Download</a></p>
<p>To use the example file, rename the file from "BOD_Mapping.txt" to
"BOD_Mapping.properties".</p>
<p>****Here you can find an explanation how the file is
structured.****</p>
<p>In the first block, all static values will be defined. Fields that would
need an adjustment are "LogicalID" and "AccountingEntityID".</p>
<p>The "LogicalID" must be set to the logical ID of the IMS connection
point that was defined for the DocBits (DOC²) BOD export.</p>
<p>The "AccountingEnity" must be set to the accounting entity of the target
Infor ERP system.</p>
