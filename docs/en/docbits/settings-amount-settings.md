## Amount Settings for Invoices with Rounding Errors

If you process invoices in countries where rounding is a matter, you may encounter rounding errors after the decimal point in certain amounts. This is because some documents contain three digits after the decimal point, but are shown on the invoice with only two decimal places. 

Docbits (DOC²)'s amount settings feature can help you handle these rounding errors. Here's an example to illustrate:

To enable this feature, simply turn on the selection in the settings:

![Enable amount settings in Docbits (DOC²)](/_images/docbits/Settings_Amount_4.png "Enable amount settings in Docbits (DOC²)")

If you don't process invoices where rounding is a matter, you can leave this selection off.

Make sure your invoices are accurate and error-free with Docbits (DOC²)'s amount settings feature. Try it out today!
