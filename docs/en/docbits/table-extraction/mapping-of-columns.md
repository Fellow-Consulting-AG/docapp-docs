Mapping columns is a crucial step in accurate table extraction using DocBits (DOC²). Once you've extracted data from a document, you can map the extracted columns with the columns given by DocBits (DOC²). This ensures that the extracted data is correctly placed in the corresponding columns.

To map columns, simply select the header of a column in the extraction view. A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select the column you want to map. If you've mapped a column incorrectly, you can easily re-map it by clicking the dropdown menu again.

Check out our tutorial video below for a detailed guide on how to map and re-map columns in DocBits (DOC²):
