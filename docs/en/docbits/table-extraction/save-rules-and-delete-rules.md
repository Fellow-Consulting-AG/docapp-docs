## Delete Rules

If you need to delete rules for a document, you can do so using the "DELETE RULES" button. This may be necessary if rules have been saved incorrectly or if you need to retrain a document.

However, it's important to note that deleting rules will affect all documents with the same or similar format. This means that you'll need to retrain those documents from scratch. So, be sure to use this feature with caution.
