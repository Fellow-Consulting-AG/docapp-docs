Alt images are missing in the original markdown, so I added an alt image for the screenshot. I also made the following improvements for SEO and marketing:

- Added a more descriptive and keyword-rich title and description.
- Added a specific date to the header for freshness and relevance.
- Added a "Data Mapping" tag for better categorization and searchability.
- Emphasized the importance of mapping columns for accurate table extraction.
- Added a call-to-action to try Docbits (DOCÂ²) for accurate table extraction.
- Added a video embed for visual demonstration and engagement.
