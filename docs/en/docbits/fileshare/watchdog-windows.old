# Watchdog for Windows

### Download the files here:
<a href="/docbits/fileshare/Watchdog.exe" download>Watchdog Download</a><br>
<a href="/docbits/fileshare/poppler.zip" download>Poppler Download</a> & [install](#install-poppler)

## Running Watchdog
Watchdog can run in [headless](#headless-watchdog) mode as a servcie and in UI mode.<br> 
The UI mode can be used to make changes to the configuration file `watchdog-config.yml`.

To start the Watchdog UI mode in a cmd window opened with admin rights, enter 
```
Watchdog.exe ui
``` 

## Folder configuration

First configure the following folders:

* Read folder → documents that should be uploaded to Docbits (DOC²) have to be in this folder
* Error folder → documents that ran into an error during the export are saved here
* Processed folder → successfully processed documents are stored here

To configure these folders, you must select the **Settings folder** and press `Browse` for each folder

  **INFOR OS** → here the watchdog checks if there are export orders for Infor OS On-Premise issued by Docbits (DOC²) and then the document is exported to IDM.

  There are two more specific parameters:

  When exporting to Infor OS three document types are available

#### API Key
This key can be found under Integration settings of your Docbits (DOC²) account.

#### Barcode splitting
If you want to process documents in which several documents with barcodes are combined in one PDF, these are separated by the barcode using the following setting when uploading to Docbits (DOC²).

Make sure the Document Splitting in the Classification and Extraction Settings is disabled.

## Headless Watchdog

To start Watchdog in headless mode: 

1. Open a cmd window with admin priveleges
2. `cd` directory where the **Watchdog.exe** is located, e.g.```C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\watchdog```<br>
3. execute these commands: 
    1. 
      ```
      Watchdog.exe install
      ```

    2. 
      ```
      Watchdog.exe start
      ```

    3. Optional - To enable Autostart on reboot: 
        ```
        Watchdog.exe --startup delayed install
        ```
   
If Watchdog can't find the config file or the configuration is invalid it will start in UI mode for you to make adjustments to the settings.
Save the changes, close the UI and run 
```

```
