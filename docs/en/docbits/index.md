Every business process starts, contains, or ends with a document. Regardless of whether it's in paper form or already as a file, this is called unstructured data. Although the information is on or in the document, it cannot be automatically integrated into the work processes, as it is simply not recognized by all software.

Docbits (DOC²) is the latest software and solution for document capture that was developed by FellowPro AG. It is a completely cloud-based solution that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to precisely identify, classify, analyze, and read your documents. No matter if paper or file. Docbits (DOC²) learns independently, the level of experience increases with each document. Docbits (DOC²) uses swarm intelligence for this.

## Why Docbits (DOC²) is Just Right for You:

Many companies have recognized that processing incoming invoices, for example, can be very time-consuming. They are trying to increase productivity and optimize the purchase-to-pay process by introducing products for the “digitization” of invoices.

In addition, Docbits (DOC²) uses swarm intelligence. What does that mean? You benefit from the experiences of other customers and their "learning curve" without sharing sensitive data. With the cloud-based rule engine, we ensure continuous improvement of the application. You don't need any developers or data scientists, because the system learns from the input of the user and the process runs without interruptions.

With the help of deep learning algorithms, not only simple header data of a document can be recorded, but also complicated structures such as tables. Of course, not only invoices are processed, but all types of documents. Regardless of whether it is waybills, membership applications, medical prescriptions, and many more.
