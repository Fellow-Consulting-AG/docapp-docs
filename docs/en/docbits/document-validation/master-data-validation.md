## Master Data Validation for Streamlined Document Processing

Docbits (DOC²) offers a powerful solution for efficient document processing: master data validation. With this feature, supplier data extracted from documents can be matched with your ERP system's master data, automatically assigning the document to the correct supplier without any manual work.

### Matching by VAT Number

One way to match supplier data is by using the VAT number extracted from the document. Docbits (DOC²) automatically matches the VAT number with the supplier master data you've uploaded to the system. The supplier ID and corresponding data, such as name and address, are then determined automatically.

If needed, you can manually intervene at any time and call up the supplier provided. This is done via the following button:

### Finding by Supplier Name

Another way to find the correct supplier is by searching for their name in the supplier master data. Simply click the button in the supplier name field and search for the supplier in the master data.
