## What is a group?

A group is a set of users that can be granted specific permissions for one or multiple document types.
The groups can be created, changed and deleted by the organization admins. Every organization admin has the rights to do this.
 
If no group is configured all privileges are granted to the users within the organization.

## Groups and privileges management

Groups are managed in DOC² under Settings > Global Settings > Groups, Users and Permissions > Groups and Permissions

### Delete
Permission to delete documents.

### First Approval
Permission to grant the first approval, if configured.

### Second Approval
