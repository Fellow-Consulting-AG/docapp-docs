## What does it do?

This a feature which, every 6 hours, uses the ION-API file to connect to your Infor-IDM and check through the newest/latest documents of the IDM-document-type(s) you selected, and if they have your specified ACL-Setting correct (for example public), it will then change it to the ACL-Setting that you want (for example private). The various connections between DOC² and Infor are illustrated below for reference.
