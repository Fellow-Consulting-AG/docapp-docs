# Docbits (DOC²) OnBoarding Guide for Productivity

Welcome to the Docbits (DOC²) OnBoarding Guide! This guide will help you learn the basics of Docbits (DOC²) and get up and running with an IPS that will maximize your productivity.

## Performing Initial Setup

To access and configure your system, go to [https://app.polydocs.io/](https://app.polydocs.io/). Please note that Docbits (DOC²) does not work in Tenant, and all customers use the same cluster hosted in Frankfurt, Germany.

Here are the two ways to access the system:

1. Contact your FellowPro AG representative or reach out to [support@polydocs.io](mailto:support@polydocs.io) to register your company.
2. Once you have received the onboarding email, you are the first user and therefore the admin of your organization.

Here is your step-by-step guide to set up:

1. Go to the [App](https://app.polydocs.io/). We recommend bookmarking this URL for future reference.
2. Log in with the credentials provided in your onboarding email.

### Step 2: Adding Users

After logging in, you'll need to add users to your tenant. When you add a user, they'll receive an onboarding email with a username and temporary password.

You can add users from **Settings** > **Users**. For help, refer to [Adding Users](/docbits/settings-users/).

## Understanding Document Review

After the initial setup is complete, most of your time in Docbits (DOC²) will be spent reviewing example invoices.

### Sending Document to Docbits (DOC²)

You can send documents to Docbits (DOC²) in the following ways:

1. Manual Upload
2. Email
3. API
4. Use our WatchDog for Directories

### Reviewing Extracted Results

If a document is not automatically processed, it will be stopped for manual review. This means you will need to edit or approve fields the system wasn't confident in, or couldn't find.

To review extracted results:

1. On the **Dashboard**, click **on the document** to assign the 10 oldest invoices in the system to yourself. You'll be taken to the **Review** screen.
2. Review the extracted results. Refer to reviewing your document for more information.
3. When you're satisfied, click **Complete Review**.
