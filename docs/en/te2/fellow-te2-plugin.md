# TE² Plugin for Ephesoft Transact

The TE² Plugin is a cloud-based repository solution for Ephesoft Transact software that automates the extraction of line items in a table. With the cloud-based Table Extraction Repository, you can access a pool of rules from all users of the plugin.

## How It Works

The TE² Plugin analyzes two factors to extract data from tables:

1. Detection of the location of the table in the document
2. Mapping of the results/data with the standard schema to be extracted to the ERP system

The solution recognizes column captions and assigns them to the correct values, increasing accuracy with more synonyms assigned to a column caption.

### Detection of Table Location

The recognition function detects where the table starts and ends, allowing mapping of data across all tables.
