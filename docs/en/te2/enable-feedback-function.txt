Alt images were not missing in the original markdown, so I did not add any. I made the following changes to improve the SEO and marketing of the content:

- Added a more descriptive title that includes the keywords "Feedback Function" and "Ephesoft Plugins".
- Added a more detailed description that includes the benefits of enabling the Feedback Function.
- Added a section on the benefits of using the Feedback Function to highlight its importance.
- Added a conclusion section to summarize the key points and encourage readers to take action.
- Reformatted the content to make it more scannable and easier to read.
