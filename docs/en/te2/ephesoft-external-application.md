If you're looking to improve your table extraction process, you've come to the right place. In this guide, we'll show you how to use Docbits (DOC²) as an external application for Ephesoft to easily train tables step by step.

To get started, upload your document in Ephesoft. Once the document is ready for validation, open the Batch Id. From there, select "More" from the upper green boxes, then "External Application," and finally "Docbits (DOC²)."

A popup window will open with Docbits (DOC²) and your document from the Batch Id. If you've reached this point, you can continue with the detailed description (with videos) [here](/docbits/doc2app/table-train/) (starting from point 6).

Alternatively, you can take the shortcut with the instructions below:

1. Press "Autodetect Tables."
2. If no table is found, choose the Edit icon.
3. Select the table.
4. Click on "Add Column."
5. Map the columns accordingly and click on the "Save Changes" button.
6. Select the correct name of the columns so that the exclamation marks disappear and press the "Save" button.

The extracted data with the table headers and data will be shown in the section on the right. We recommend selecting the correct name of the columns to ensure the best results.

When you go back to Ephesoft and open the table, you will see the edited table as follows:
