# Data Security Measures of Doc²

At Doc², we understand the importance of data security and take it very seriously. We have implemented robust measures to ensure the safety and privacy of your uploaded files and sensitive information. Here are some of the measures we have in place:

## Uploaded Files

All uploaded files are stored in an object storage hosted by our Cloud Provider. Access is restricted and only possible with the correct key and secret key. We also use encryption to protect your files from unauthorized access.

## Database

We run daily database backups that are saved for seven days each. Communication between the database and servers is only done via HTTPS. Stored passwords are encrypted in a way that even with access to the database, they cannot be read.

## Server Communication

All communication is done via HTTPS, and every non-HTTPS request is automatically redirected to HTTPS. This ensures that all data transmitted between our servers and your device is encrypted and secure.

At Doc², we are committed to providing our users with the highest level of data security. You can trust us to keep your sensitive information safe and secure.
