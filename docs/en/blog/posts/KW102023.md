# Ephesoft vs DocBits: When Should You Use Each for IDP?

Intelligent document processing (IDP) solutions like Ephesoft and DocBits use AI to automate data extraction from documents. But when should you use one versus the other?

## On-Premises vs Cloud

The biggest difference is that *Ephesoft is an on-premises solution you install and run on your own servers*. This allows full control and customization, but requires IT resources for deployment and maintenance.

DocBits is a cloud-based SaaS platform that runs on DocBits servers. This reduces infrastructure costs and IT overhead for you. However, you have less control compared to an on-prem solution.

If you prefer keeping systems in-house and have the IT capacity, Ephesoft may be better. For low maintenance and rapid implementation, consider DocBits.

## AI and Machine Learning

Both tools use advanced AI and machine learning for automated data extraction. However, *DocBits specializes in deep learning* for more accurate extraction from complex and handwritten documents.

Ephesoft relies more on rules-based extraction which requires upfront configuration. DocBits continuously learns with little input required.

## Integrations

Out-of-the-box, *Ephesoft provides connectors to many ECMs and ERPs like SharePoint, Box, and SAP*. DocBits has specialized connectors for Infor ERPs like CloudSuite and LN.

If you need broad compatibility, Ephesoft has you covered. For dedicated Infor integration, DocBits is built specifically for it.

## European Market Focus

*DocBits is tailored for the European market* - designed for regional document formats like invoices. It also leverages swarm intelligence from European customers to improve.

Ephesoft is US-based with global customers. So DocBits may perform better for Europe-specific documents.

## conclusion

In summary:

For on-premises deployments, deep integration, and customization - Ephesoft is a great choice
For fast cloud setup, Infor ERP focus, and EU documents - DocBits is ideal
