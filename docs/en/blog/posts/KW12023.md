- Updated version of the application.
- Updated the version number of FellowPro's Cloud App.
- Added try-except block to catch exceptions when downloading a document from the store.

## Web - App
- Updated dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities
- Updated version of the code
- Updated version of the application
- Updated version from 2.18.0 to 2.18.1
- The saveTemplate function previously did not provide any feedback on whether the save was successful or not. By emitting a boolean value, the calling code can now determine whether the save was successful and take appropriate action.
- Refactored the DocumentClassification component to use composition API and added type annotations for better type checking and readability.
- The copyTemplate function in this component previously passed a JSON object to the copyToClipboard function. However, the copyToClipboard function expects a string as its argument. This has been updated to pass the stringified version of the JSON object instead.
- Refactored the DocumentClassification component to use Vue 3 composition API and added type annotations for better type checking.
- Added z-index to the class of a button and added horizontal, disable, after-class, before-class, and separator-class attributes to q-splitter. Also added a new template for q-btn and q-splitter.
- The code contains commented out debugger statements that are used for debugging purposes. These statements should be removed before the code is deployed to production as they can cause security issues and performance problems.
- Added z-index to the menu button to ensure it is above other elements
- The code contains hardcoded values instead of using constants or configuration files.
- Changed the save icon click event to emit a 'saveTemplate' event with a boolean parameter
- The code contains commented out debugger statements that can cause issues in production environments and should be removed before deployment.
- The code has been modified to fix a bug or add a new feature
- The code changes the layout of a table in the web application to display more information about a document, including its title, creation date, content, and buttons for downloading, editing, and finding similar documents. It also adds a default name for documents that do not have a title.

| Refactored the code to extract the template_id from the image path and use it to set the template_folder variable. This will ensure that the correct template folder is used for each page of the layout.                          | Amier    | `refactor`                        |        3 |
