## Web - App
- This week, we made significant improvements to the FellowPro IDP for process documents, including adding new fields to the form, improving code readability and maintainability, and adding validation for list of values rule. We also made changes to improve the functionality and performance of the application, such as changing the way the baseUrl is set and refactoring the code to pass the field name as a parameter. These changes will enhance the user experience and make the application more efficient and effective.
- Modified the formBuilderConfigModel object to include a columns array and adding column properties to it

- Added a value property to the column object for easier access to the formatted value.
- Added a new 'value' property to the columns object and set its value based on the column type.

| The code change involves commenting out one line of code and uncommenting another. Specifically, the line `task_result = process_trocr_fields.delay(token, user.id, doc_rec.id, start_time)` is commented out, and the line `task_result = create_trocr_task(token, user, doc_rec.id, fields)` is uncommented.                                         | Benjamin        | `code change, commenting out code, uncommenting code` |        5 |
| Changed the way the baseUrl is set to use the process.env.APP_VUE_DOC2_SERVICE_URL variable instead of hardcoding it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Amna            | `refactor`                                            |        3 |
| This change ensures that the showConnectionFromField function is only called when allowAreaSelection is true.

| The code change updates the styling of the primary button in the web application. The color of the button was changed from a darker shade of blue (#2388AE) to a lighter shade (#2388ae) to improve the contrast with the white background. Additionally, the 'color' prop was added to the q-btn component to explicitly set the color of the button. | Benjamin        | `UI, Styling`                                         |        2 |
| Added a new 'value' property to the columns object and set its value based on the column type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Asad            | `enhancement`                                         |        5 |
