| The code change modifies the extract_document_fields function to include table field information in the doc_fields dictionary. This allows for easier handling of table fields in the code.                                                                                                                                                                        | Asad     | `enhancement` |        3 |
| The code change updates the classification usage log for the user with the KEY_FELLOW_DOC2 and the page count of the uploaded document. The classification usage log is updated with a value of 1 for each page of the document. The third argument is a string that specifies the type of classification used, which is CUSTOM_MODEL_CLASSIFICATION in this case. | Amier    | `enhancement` |        5 |
