# Streamline Order Confirmations with Infor LN and DocBits

Processing order confirmations is a crucial step in procurement workflows. But it often requires tedious and error-prone manual work.

Infor LN along with *DocBits document processing* provides an automated solution to greatly simplify order confirmation handling.

The Challenges of Manual Order Confirmations
Typical issues with paper-based order confirmations:

- Data entry errors leading to mismatches with original orders
- Difficulty matching line items/SKUs between documents
- Processing delays holding up downstream supply chain processes
- No audit trail or visibility into confirmation status
  
This results in bloated processing costs, frustrated suppliers, and procurement bottlenecks.
