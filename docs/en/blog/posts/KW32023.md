- Included the doc_id parameter in the url of the API call
- Removed unused imports and cleaned up formatting
- Added a retry mechanism to the image classification process, which attempts to classify the image up to 3 times with a 10 second delay between attempts
- Updated the API endpoint URL to reflect a shift to a cloud-based production environment
- Closed the database session after use to prevent memory leaks and improve performance
- Replaced the commented line of code that converts the image to BGR with a new line of code that uses the `strip_box` function with a `fill_percent_threshold` parameter set to 0
- Removed unused code and commented out lines
- Added a try-finally block to ensure that the database session is closed after use
- Added a new key-value pair to the doc_field dictionary to store the 'tr_ocr_model_id' field from the layout_field dictionary
- Added exception handling and retry logic for image classification API calls
- Improved code readability by reformatting the code
- Changed the `strip_box` function call to include a `fill_percent_threshold` parameter with a value of 0


## API
- The code includes a commented out block that is not being used and can be safely removed.
- The code change adds new functionality to the DocDetails class, allowing users to get and set metadata for a document. This can be useful for storing additional information about a document, such as author, date created, or keywords.
- Changed the user attribute in the timeline model from user ID to user email
- The code change modifies the 'get_doc_timeline' function in the 'Timeline' class to order the timeline list in descending order by the 'created_on' attribute instead of ascending order.
- The code has been modified to handle metadata fields better. The existing fields are now checked against the metadata fields and new fields are created if they do not exist. The metadata fields are then used to populate the document fields.
- Changed user ID to user email for better identification
- The code now closes the database connection after processing a new document or exporting a document, and reopens it when needed. This reduces the number of open connections and improves performance.
- Added new functionality to the DocDetails class for metadata storage

- Modified `get_store` method to filter query by `store_id`
- Added type hint for `store_type` parameter in `create_store` method
- Modified `get_store_by_org` method to filter query by `org_id`
- The DocDetails class now has two new methods to get and set metadata of a document. This will allow for easier access and manipulation of metadata associated with a document.
- Added a comment for Pytest coverage
- Change user in doc2light timeline to string
- The order of the imported modules in the file was changed to group them by their source. This makes it easier to read and understand the dependencies of the file.
- Uncommented the code block that adds a logtail handler to the logger, allowing log messages to be sent to a remote log management service.
- Changed the way to check if a field is validated or not
- Added a new endpoint for retrieving document metadata
- The code change involves removing the import of 'starlette.responses.StreamingResponse' and adding the import of 'fastapi.responses.JSONResponse'.
- Added multiple Google libraries
- Updated the build process to include installing dependencies before building the project
- Changed the condition for selecting records to set to error
- Updated the CircleCI pipeline trigger action to use the official CircleCI-Public version instead of the FellowFellow version.
- The timeout and soft_time_limit values have been increased to allow the task to run for a longer period of time before timing out or being terminated.


## Web - App
- Sets the value of headerFabIcon to false when the selection list is cleared
- Changed the condition to check for 'image_data' instead of 'image' property and added a message for when no image is found.
- Added a new CSS class to set the z-index of an element to 1.
- Changed the disable and class bindings for the q-item element in the doctype dropdown to use the hasDocTypes property of the option object.
- Added a new CSS class called warning-holder to give a specific background color to warning messages in the web application.
- The applyFuzzySearchWrapper function was updated to call the applyMasterDataSearchForField function instead of the applyFuzzySearch function. This change was made to improve the functionality of the application by allowing the user to search for master data using the fuzzy search feature.
- Changed the naming convention of the property from camelCase to snake_case.
- Added a new CSS rule for highlighting text extracted by OCR
- Changed the right margin of an element from 23px to 14px
- Changed the way of adding a class to an element from setAttribute to classList.add
- The 'el' option in Vue.js is deprecated and has been replaced with the 'setup' function. This change updates the code to use the new 'setup' function instead of the deprecated 'el' option.
- The code change adds a try-catch block to the getScript method in useDocScriptStore to handle errors that may occur during the API call. If an error occurs, the script_data property of the all_data object for the selected document type is set to an empty string and the error is thrown. This ensures that the application does not break if an error occurs during the API call.
- Changed label from 'Create New Field' to 'Form Elements'
- The debounceArticleSearchFunc function was used to debounce the article search function, but it was removed along with its usage in the calculateArticleNumber and inputValueChanges functions. This means that the article search function will no longer be debounced.
- Updated the CircleCI trigger action version from v1.0.4 to v1.0.6
- Added a new Vue component for displaying custom columns in the settings page.
- Updated version from 2.19.1 to 2.19.2
- Updated dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities

- Added a new component for extracting tables from documents.
- Modified CSS styles of select elements and a button.
- Added a new table to display data in the web application.
- Added a new component for extracting tables from documents

- The code is emitting an event with a boolean value instead of a number
- Changed the $emit event to pass a boolean value instead of toggling the extracted column mode

| The code changes involve modifying the checkbox selection logic in the web application. The code changes include modifying the `q-checkbox` component to use the `getDashboardDocData` method to get the row selection data for a document instead of using the `dashboardDocs` object directly. The `selectionList` method has also been modified to update the `rowSelection` property of the document data object instead of updating the `dashboardDocs` object directly. The `selectAllRows` method has been modified to use the `getDashboardDocIds` and `getDashboardDocData` methods to get the document data instead of using the `apidata_doc` object directly. | Shehryar      | `checkbox selection, web application` |        5 |
| The code is emitting an event with a boolean value instead of a number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Amier         | `bug, needs review`                   |        7 |
