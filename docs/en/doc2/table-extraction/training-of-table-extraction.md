## Training Mode vs Correction Mode

When using our table extraction tool, you can choose between training mode and correction mode. Here's what you need to know about each mode:

### Training Mode

In training mode, mapped columns are read-only, and you cannot manually change the text. Additionally, the delete row button is not visible.

In correction mode, you can delete and add rows, and you can manually change the text of mapped columns.
