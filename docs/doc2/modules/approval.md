Here you can see that you enable the Approval features to your liking.

## Exporting

When you are ready to export a document and have selected an export option from the dropdown at the bottom of the document, as shown below

The document is now waiting to be approved.

You can set the approver by using the assign button on the Dashboard and you can also set the e-mail notification for that person(s), accessible via Settings > Email Notification.

On this screen the approver can add comments and select who approved the document. When done, the approver can save and then approve the document.


## Second Approval

After second approval the document will go into the status of “Pending Second Approval”.

The same process occurs as in the 1st approval (the assignee will receive an email with a link) and they will be taken to the same screen for the 2nd approval.

After the 2nd approver has saved and approved the document, only then will the document be exported.
