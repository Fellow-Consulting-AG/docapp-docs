Once data is extracted from a document you are able to map the extracted columns with the columns given by DOC².

That can be done by selecting the header of a column in extraction view.

A drop-down will open and you will be able to select the column that you want to map.

If a column has been mapped incorrectly you can simply re-map the column by clicking the drop-down menu again.
