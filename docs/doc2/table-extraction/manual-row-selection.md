# Manual row selection

It is possible for some documents to have text in rows that are not only written under one specific coloumn. It might be that it is written over multiple columns like in the example below:

![](/_images/doc2/Table Extraction/7-Manual row selection/Image_23_doc_example.png)

On the screenshot you can see that the table and columns have already been defined. After having a detailed look over the highlighted information (PRAEF) you will recognize that the text is written through columns "Bezeichnung", "Menge", "ME" and "Preis in EUR".

In this case it is not possible for the system to automatically define to which column the information belongs.

To solve this issue DOC² offers you the option to manually select and map information on a document to any column.

First of all, make sure "Training Mode" is activated:

Next you need to activate "Row Data Edit Mode":

Please note that the manual mapping of text to a column is only possible for extractable columns (blue colour):

The rows highlighted in violet can not be mapped manually as the mapping has already been done via the columns defined on the document.

Extractable columns need to be created first. You can learn how to do this here: [Add new table column](/doc2/table/add-new-table-column/)

Once the column has been created, and you have activated both "Training Mode" and "Row Data Edit Mode" will you be able to map text on the document to the column as shown in the video below:

In the video you can see how to:

- select an area with your mouse
- double click a value to select the area (only possible for values without spaces)
- delete mapping and re-map an area
